                  pipes it through the standard gzip + ustar extract.
                  No tag resolution (the URL is already the locator).
      skLocal   — a filesystem path; recursively copied into the
                  modules tree. No version resolution.

    The earlier skRelease + skHttp kinds are removed: release assets
    are reachable via the URL form; tag resolution via git smart-HTTP

    (* [build] — replaces the legacy [targets] section (ADR-0011 §
       "build-section rename"). Two recognised shapes:

         (1) Multi-entry: each child is one build item.
             [build.cli]
             source = "src/app.pas"
             output = "bin/app"
             prebuild  = { stamp-version = "scripts/stamp.pas" }
             postbuild = { sign = "scripts/sign.pas" }

         (2) Single-entry shorthand: [build] carries `source` (and
             optional `output`) DIRECTLY, no nested item name. The
             item defaults to [package].name; the single binary
             output defaults to "build/<package-name>" if absent.
             [build]
             source = "src/main.pas"

       Detection: if [build] has a child named `source`, we treat
       it as shorthand. Otherwise every child is a build item. *)
    { [workspaces] — monorepo workspace declaration (ADR-0014
      amendment "Workspaces"). Parsed for ALL manifests just like
      [package] and [dependencies] so a workspace's own lwpt.toml
      can declare its own nested workspaces (yarn-berry-style
      worktrees). Glob shape mirrors [format]'s include / exclude
      — same parser. Discovery walks the globs relative to the
      manifest's directory, intersects with dirs containing a valid
      lwpt.toml, then auto-adds each match as a virtual local-path
      dep on Result.Deps (Q21=auto-install). Explicit entries
      already-present in [dependencies] with the same name take
      precedence (skip auto-add for those — the user has overriden).

      Supply-chain note: unlike hooks (which fire arbitrary code on
      install + so are root-only), workspaces are code-organisation
      (local paths only, no arbitrary execution). Parsing them in
      child manifests is safe; the resolver enqueues their auto-
      added virtual deps the same way it would any explicit dep. }

  Tag resolution — turn a (VersionKind, VersionSpec) pair into

    vkSemverRange → ListRemoteRefs + MaxSatisfying, with v-prefix
                    stripped on the tag-list side for comparison.
                    Returns the matched tag's wire name (with or

                    tag list; first match wins.

  Hardening helpers — atomic writes via .lwpt/tmp/ with EXDEV fallback.

  The contract from AGENTS.md Hard Constraints: every multi-step write
  to a committed path goes through .lwpt/tmp/ + atomic rename. A crash
  mid-write leaves the orphan in tmp (cleaned up by lwpt repair or by
  the next lwpt install's startup pass), never a half-written archive
  / module tree / lockfile / cfg.

  Atomic-rename across filesystems fails with EXDEV on POSIX (28 on
  Darwin/Linux; the constant differs between RTL builds). The fallback
  is byte-copy then delete — still safer than direct overwrite because
  the source remains untouched until the copy completes. ADR-0002
  consequences mentions this; docs/tooling.md is the canonical reference.

  Archive extraction — gunzip (zstream) then a direct ustar/POSIX tar reader.

  This replaces FPC's libtar, which has an incomplete ustar reader: it
  ignores the 155-byte `prefix` field (header offset 345). GitHub tarballs
  routinely split long paths as prefix + '/' + name (the standard ustar
  way to encode paths up to 255 chars), so libtar silently truncated and
  dropped every entry whose path exceeded 100 bytes. This reader joins
  prefix+name correctly and also follows GNU 'L'/'K' long-name entries.

  Header layout (512-byte block, POSIX 1003.1 ustar):
    0   name      100      124  size       12
    100 mode      8        136  mtime      12

                           345  prefix     155

  removes it so Dest holds package contents directly (clean -Fu paths).

  Resolver — flat graph, highest-compatible selection, hard conflict error.

  SPIKE NOTE: a full resolver walks each fetched package's own lwpt.toml to

  SHA-256  (self-contained, public-domain algorithm)

  FPC 3.2.2's `hash` package ships md5 and sha1 but NOT sha256, and the
  spike must run on 3.2.2. SHA-1 was rejected: it is dated for content
  integrity and skills-lock.json's `computedHash` field already commits to
  SHA-256-shaped values. So SHA-256 is inlined here. Validated below
  against the canonical "abc" test vector.

  TSHA256Digest = array[0..31] of Byte;

{ SHA-256 performs intentional modular arithmetic on 32-bit values
  (Cardinals): the compression loop's `temp1 := h + s1 + ch + K[t] + W[t]`
  and `W[t] := W[t-16] + s0 + W[t-7] + s1` deliberately wrap on
  overflow — that's how the algorithm produces correct hashes. FPC's
  range check ({$R+}) detects the intermediate Int64-promoted sums
  exceeding Cardinal's range and raises EangeError. Disable range
  checking inside this function so the modular arithmetic runs as
  written. The unit tests (NIST vectors) don't catch this because
  the test compiler doesn't pass -Cr; lwpt's dev build does, and the
  network-source archive-hash path was the first call site to hit
  it after the matching ADR. }

  Transitive BFS resolver.

  Walks the dependency graph breadth-first starting from the root manifest.
  For each not-yet-seen package: fetch + extract it, read its own lwpt.toml,
  record the version constraint, and enqueue its dependencies. Every
  constraint seen for a given package name is accumulated; after the walk
  each package's constraints must be jointly satisfiable by one concrete
  version (FPC's single global unit namespace forbids coexistence), else a
  hard conflict naming both requirers.

  SPIKE SCOPE: concrete version selection from a registry is not modelled —
  for github/release sources the ref IS the concrete version, so the check
  is "do all requirers point at a compatible ref/range". A flat HTTP
  registry with multiple published versions would add a selection step
  here; the constraint-accumulation and conflict logic is the reusable core.

  Test runner — discover *.Test.pas units, compile each, run, aggregate.

  A *.Test.pas file is a self-contained program: it uses TestingPascalLibrary,
  defines TTestSuite subclasses, and its begin..end block runs them and sets
  ExitCode via TestResultToExitCode. So LWPT does not parse test output — it
  compiles each file and reads the process exit code (0 = pass).

  Per ADR-0015 the TestingPascalLibrary unit lives in the `testing`
  workspace package (graduated from an embedded binary blob + the
  `lwpt export testing` extrude-on-demand model that preceded it).
  `lwpt install` symlinks `packages/testing/` into `.lwpt/modules/testing/`;
  the cfg emitter wires `-Fu` / `-Fi` to it like any other workspace dep.
  CmdTest itself adds nothing to the search path beyond what the
  manifest's units + the modules dir already provide — the testing
  library is just a dep.

  Build — compile manifest targets.

  Generalises GocciaScript build.pas: its eight hardcoded BuildXxx procedures
  (each = RunCommand fpc FPCArgs(literal-path)) collapse into one loop over
  the manifest's [targets]. FPCArgs' dev/prod flag sets are kept as-is (good
  defaults); @config.cfg becomes @lwpt.cfg, the file `lwpt install` emits.
  GenerateVersionInclude becomes the optional [version] manifest section.

  Build-lifecycle hook executor (ADR-0011).

  Sequential, stop-on-first-failure, manifest-insertion-order (preserved
  through TOML → OrderedStringMap). Hooks with a paired inputs/output
  field gate-skip when the output is newer than every input; hooks
  without that pair always run. InstantFPC is the only execution channel
  (cross-platform without shell-vs-bat-vs-sh hell — scripts shell out
  to other tools via TProcess if they need to).

  Phase failure aborts the rest of the section: a non-zero exit code
  (or a TProcess spawn failure) raises ELWPTError naming the hook +
  the phase + the exit status, and the caller propagates that as the
  subcommand's exit code. =========================================================================== }
