  CmdRun — invoke a user-declared run-script (ADR-0013).

  AName is the section name (the manifest key for the script). When
  AName is empty, prints a list of every callable name (subcommands
  first, then user scripts). When AName matches no script and no
  subcommand, exits 1 with a hint listing both sets.

  Subcommand-aliasing (`lwpt run install` → `lwpt install`) is handled
  upstream in the CLI dispatcher (CLI.Subcommands.Run) — CmdRun is
  only reached for genuine user scripts. }

  { Execute the script directly and propagate its exit code (npm-run
    convention). Differs from lifecycle hooks (which raise on non-zero
    to abort the phase): a user-invoked script's exit code is the
    *answer* the user is asking for, so any propagation other than
    "what the script returned" loses information. }
